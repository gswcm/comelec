				Introduction
			</h2>
			<p>
				The <strong>ComElec</strong> application is intended to assist with the standing committee election process that is conducted annually based on <i>preferences of participating faculty members</i> and expert decision of members of the <i>GSW Faculty Senate</i>. Early in the cycle, ordinary faculty provide personal preferences for their next year committee assignment, then, the GSW Faculty Senate processes all individual preferences along with other guidances and makes the final assignment.
			</p>
			<p>
				The application has 2 interfaces
				<ul>
					<li>
						Public interface for all faculty members to use to submit committee preferences. Up to 3 committees can be selected.
					</li>
					<li>
						Admin interface for the members of the Faculty Senate allowing for the assisted distribution of all faculty into the set of existing committees.
					</li>
				</ul>

				How it works
			</h2>
			<h3>
				For regular users (faculty)
			</h3>
			<p>
				The process starts from allowing a faculty member to identify herself by means of providing official GSW email address. That address is cooked up against faculty/staff user directory to identify the real user's name. On the next step the history of previous committee services for this given user is examined to display the list summarizing committee assignments for the last 3 years.
			</p>
			<p>
				The user then is asked to choose the preference for 3 committees for the next year cycle. Once preference is submitted a confirmation email will be sent to the associated email address. A confirmation link from the email has to be followed for the purposes of integrity assurance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The process can be repeated arbitrary number of times before the set deadline. The deadline can be estimated as a week before the GSW Planning Week which is normally scheduled in early days of August.
