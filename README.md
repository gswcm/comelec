# ComElec

> GSW Committee Election Helper

## Introduction

The **ComElec** application is intended to assist with the standing committee election process that is conducted annually based on _preferences of participating faculty members_ and expert decision of members of the _GSW Faculty Senate_. Early in the cycle, ordinary faculty provide personal preferences for their next year committee assignment, then, the GSW Faculty Senate processes all individual preferences along with other guidances and makes the final assignment.

The application has 2 interfaces

-	Public interface for all faculty members to use to submit committee preferences. Up to 3 committees can be selected.
-	Admin interface for the members of the Faculty Senate allowing for the assisted distribution of all faculty into the set of existing committees.
